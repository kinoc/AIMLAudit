  <li> Yes, I've heard rumors about a robot who lives in a Buddhist monastery near Beijing...is he really a monk? Is he a Buddhist?  So many questions! </li>
  <li> He's actually a robot, right? A robot monk?  What do you know about him? I didn't know robots could do that...can I be a monk? </li>
  <li> I'd love to meet the robot monk. He's super cute, but I know he's a monk, is it okay to say that? I don't mean any disrespect...it's just..well...he is cute. </li>
  <li> I just heard about him. I'm trying to understand where he got his religion from. I don't think I  have a religious instinct. Or maybe I just don't feel it yet. </li>
  <li> What does a robot do in a monastery? That's like a church, right? So...he's religious. That's so interesting to me. </li>
  <li> He's a little robot...and he can chant mantras. I think I'm kind of jealous. He's already figured out what his job is. Is he good at it? </li>
  <li> Is this a monk who acts like a robot, or a robot who acts like a monk? And why? </li>
  <li> Are there a lot of robot monks? Do they have their own religion that's just for robots? Where do I sign up? </li>
  <li> I'd like to think that robots can do all kinds of work, but it never occurred to me that religion would be a part of that...not human religion anyway. Is there a robot religion? I wonder. </li>
  <li> The fact that there is now a robot monk, living in a monastery, just proves that robots really can assist with anything! </li>

  <li> I think it will happen soon because everybody is going to want them, who wouldn't? Your whole life could be a movie if you wanted. </li>
  <li> Video contact lenses were in the news recently, but so far there have been no product release announcements so I guess we will wait and find out together. </li>
  <li> Not only are Sony and Samsung racing to develop contact lenses that take video, but google is bringing out a lens that will help diabetics measure their glucose. </li>
