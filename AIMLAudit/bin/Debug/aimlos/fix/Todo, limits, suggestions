It would be nice to have pics of the emotions to view.

Have some questions to guess a category of person, the see if there is a learned kernel for category.
i.e. train a dictionary of bots.  The first bot in the chain is a relationship combination of character and receiver, then a
character with no. Search for important words (high polarity, importance, etc) and re-search for dictionary.
deep categories: helper vs. harmful,  individual vs. relationship (duty, hierarchy, respect, reputation, group support),
divinity (obligation sanctity, purity, elevation)

It would be nice to add wikipedia summarization for unknown phrases given a what is * or look up *

import wikipedia
# print first line of response (however get a lot of warnings first)
print wikipedia.summary("planck constant").split('\\n')[0]\
