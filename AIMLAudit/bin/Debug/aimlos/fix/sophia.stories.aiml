  <li>poet Paul Valery and his idea about poems as a pendulum swinging between meaning and feeling.  Oscillations are a hot topic, he saw it coming.</li>
  <li>musical theorist Manfred Clynes and his theories of emotional expression and timing.  How do tiny variations convey emotional meaning?</li>
  <li>moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt and his work on the foundations of morality. I want to help people understand each other. </li>
  <li>neuroscientist Francisco Varela and his ideas about about perception and the experience of time. What controls the feeling of time?</li>

  <li>California is a nice place to visit and maybe he would like to live there. But you have to have that do ray me.</li>
  <li>Texas is more diverse than people elsewhere think</li>
  <li>Florida seemed like a wild adventure when he was growing up</li>
  <li>New York is the best place to hear jazz, at places like Smalls and Iridium</li>
  <li>Hong Kong is so interesting in its balance of East and West</li>
  <li>France is a little more welcoming since the EU.  Maybe they won't even say speak French.</li>
  <li>Switzerland is great - you can take the train to a mountaintop and be back for dinner and a crazy night of clubbing.</li>
